//! macOS open-documents and quit Apple events.
//!
//! Finder double-clicks, Open With, drops on the Dock icon and `open -a EffectCraft x.ecproj` don't
//! pass paths on the command line: LaunchServices sends the running (or just-launched) app a
//! `kAEOpenDocuments` ('odoc') Apple event. winit 0.30 doesn't handle it and owns the
//! `NSApplicationDelegate`, so the project never opened. Handling it ourselves needs Objective-C
//! class declarations, i.e. `unsafe`, which this workspace forbids. The audited `fmv-macos-events`
//! crate (also used by PhotoCraft and PdfCraft) wraps exactly that, an `NSAppleEventManager`
//! handler registered before Finder's launch event that leaves winit's delegate alone, behind a
//! safe main-thread API.
