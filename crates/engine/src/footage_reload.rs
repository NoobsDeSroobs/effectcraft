//! Footage that changed on disk: File ▸ Reload Footage (Cmd+Alt+L) and Settings ▸ Import ▸
//! Reload Footage Changed on Disk.
//!
//! Reloading re-reads what the file decides (its size, a movie's duration, streams and frame
//! rate, the codec, a data file's text) and keeps what the project decided: the Photoshop layer
//! or PDF page an item shows and its interpretation (alpha, conformed frame rate, pixel aspect,
//! fields, colour). A Photoshop layer is found again by name when layers were added or removed
//! around it. The media layer then forgets the file and the layer cache is emptied, so the next
//! render reads the new pixels.
//!
//! The automatic part compares each footage file's size and modification time with what they
//! were when the file was last seen. The desktop app takes those stamps every two seconds (and
//! when its window comes back to the front) on a worker thread, so a file on a slow network share
//! never holds up the interface ([`start_scan`], [`poll_scan`]); `footage.reloadChanged` takes them
//! on the spot (CLI, agents, tests). Like the footage check after File ▸ Open, an automatic reload
//! records the state of the disk: it is not an undo step and doesn't modify the project.
